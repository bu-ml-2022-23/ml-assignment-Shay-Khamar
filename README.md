# Machine Learning Assignment README

For full details of the assignment, please see the assignment brief on Brightspace for the Machine Learning unit: ``Content`` --> ``Assessment``.


## Content

This repository contains the following:

* a selection of datasets (in the ``data`` folder),
* a Jupyter Notebook (``ml-assignment.ipynb``) that loads one of the datasets


## Using the Jupyter Notebook

You will hopefully be familiar with this from the Machine Learning labs, but in case you have forgotten, then you can start Jupyter Notebook from the command line / terminal by executing the following command:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

This should automatically launch a web browser where you can find your code to view and run the notebook.

If you don't have Jupyter Notebooks installed on your machine, have a look at **LAB ZERO** for the unit!
